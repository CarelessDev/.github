🛠 CarelessDev Tech Stack - "FUCKMYASS"
At CarelessDev, we use a unique blend of technologies that we affectionately call the "FUCKMYASS" stack. While the name might raise eyebrows, each letter represents a robust and efficient tool that powers our "useless innovations."

F - FastAPI
🚀 Our back-end runs on FastAPI, providing us with a super-fast and efficient API framework that is as agile as our ideas. It brings modern Python features like type hinting to create intuitive and clean code.

U - Uvicorn
🦄 The magic isn't complete without Uvicorn. It serves as our ASGI server, connecting the world to our FastAPI application. Uvicorn is all about performance and simplicity, exactly how we like it.

C - Cloudflare
☁️ Safety first, right? Cloudflare provides us with top-notch security and optimizes our network performance. Whether it's DDoS protection or CDN services, Cloudflare has got our back.

K - Kubernetes
🐳 We use Kubernetes for container orchestration. It makes the deployment, scaling, and management of our applications seamless, so we can focus on innovating rather than troubleshooting.

MY - MySQL
🗄️ Data might not be the coolest part of what we do, but it's crucial. MySQL provides us with a robust and reliable relational database to store and manage data.

AS - Astro
🌠 For building our front-end, we use Astro, a framework that lets us create incredibly fast and modern websites without making compromises.

S - Svelte
🎨 We love Svelte for the dynamic parts of our UI. It compiles components down to highly-efficient vanilla JavaScript, making our applications lean and fast.
